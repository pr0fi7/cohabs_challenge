## 📝 Overview

Cohabs is a modern, full‑stack web application built to streamline the tenant experience in co‑living and residential communities. It brings together:

- A **conversational AI assistant** powered by Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions, fetch documents, and help you navigate the portal.
- A **calendar of community events**, with search, filtering, RSVPs, and the ability for tenants to suggest new activities.
- A **ticketing system** for reporting maintenance issues, tracking statuses, and communicating with building management.
- A **billing dashboard** for viewing current rent, payment history, and managing saved payment methods.
- A **profile center** where tenants can update personal information, notification preferences, and lease details.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Chat Assistant (RAG‑Enabled)

- **Natural‑language interface**: Ask “What’s the rent due date?” or “What are today’s events?”, all the information can be taken from the documents loaded to the db, using 'admin/upload' endpoint
- **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation**: The assistant combines your chat history with indexed building documents (leases, policies, guides) to provide accurate, context‑aware answers.
- **Quick‑reply buttons**: One‑tap actions like “Report Issue”, “View Events”, or “Check Billing.”
- **Persistent threads**: Your entire conversation is stored in PostgreSQL so you can revisit past chats at any time.

### 2. Event Management

- **Browse & RSVP**: See all upcoming community events, filter by type (social, fitness, educational, maintenance), search by keywords, and mark yourself as “Going” or “Can’t Make It.”
- **Suggest new events**: Fill out a quick form with date/time, description, location, and capacity to propose a gathering.
- **Organizers dashboard**: Admins can review submissions, approve or modify event details, and publish them to the community calendar.

### 3. Support Tickets

- **File a ticket**: Report maintenance issues with titles, descriptions, and optional file attachments (photos, documents).
- **Track status**: Tickets move through statuses—Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed—with visual badges and icons.
- **Comment & update**: Tenants and staff can exchange messages and upload additional attachments until the issue is resolved.

### 4. Billing & Payments

- **Current bill summary**: View your monthly rent amount, due date, and outstanding status (Pending, Paid, Overdue).
- **Payment history**: A searchable, filterable list of past payments with receipts available for download.
- **Manage payment methods**: Add, remove, and designate a default credit card or bank account.

### 5. Profile & Account Settings

- **Personal info**: Update your name, email, phone number, and avatar.
- **Lease details**: View move‑in/move‑out dates, unit number, and download your lease agreement.
- **Notifications**: Toggle email, push, billing alerts, event reminders, and maintenance updates.
- **Security & privacy**: Change password, review any third‑party integrations, and sign out securely.
